# TakeMyQuiz
Project creating a short timed quiz
 
 I began by first deciding what was needed and what would change 

 I created the html first by having a header which would display which question i was on, a div to actually hold my question, and answer choices. 
 Next i created some variables to refrence back key points of my code. eg "position" to show current question position, "correct" to give a value of how many correct questions have been answered. 
 Then made variables to refrence the elements in my html file. 
 finally made an array that held my four questions, and their answer choices with the correct answer.

Next i started to create functions to begin rendering my work.

Overall getting through the structure and main functions down i came across a problem, when user clicks the answer choice they want, it doesnt move on.

Created a div to hold my timer countdown function.
